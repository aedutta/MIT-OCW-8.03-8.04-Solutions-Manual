\begin{sol}
As before, let us let $\xi\equiv a\kappa = \sqrt{\frac{2ma_0E}{\hbar^2}}=1$. Due to the symmetry of the hydrogen atom, we wish to find even solutions, giving:
$$\xi=\eta \tan \eta$$
and
$$z_0^2=\eta^2+\xi^2$$
We have two unknowns $z_0$ and $\eta$ so solving for $z_0$ gives
$$z_0=1.3192$$
It's easy to show that
$$z_0^2=\frac{V_0}{E}$$
so
$$V_0=z_0^2E = 23.67 \text{ eV}$$
