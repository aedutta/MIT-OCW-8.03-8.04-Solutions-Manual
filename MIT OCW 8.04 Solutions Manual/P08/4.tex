\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item For a wavepacket built with energies $E < V_0$, we remember that $B/A = -e^{2i\delta(E)}$ where $B$ and $A$ represent the reflected and transmitted components respectively. This then means that the associated reflected wavepacket is given as 
    \[\Psi_{\text{ref}} = -\sqrt{a} \int_{0}^{\hat{k}} dk \Phi (k) e^{2i \delta (E)} e^{-ikx}e^{-i E(k)t/\hbar}.\]
