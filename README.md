# MIT-OCW-8.03 & 8.04-Solutions-Manual

Work in progress. These are solutions to MIT's 8.03 (Vibrations & Waves) and 8.04 (Quantum Physics I) courses that I wrote in high school. These are likely not going to be modified any further, so feel free to take these solutions and add your own.

Thanks to Rakshit (8.03), Qilin Xue (8.04), and Aarush Gupta (8.04) who also helped create the solutions. Solutions are yet to be checked and any corrections will be appreciated.
