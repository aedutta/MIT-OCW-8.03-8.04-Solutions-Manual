\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{(\alph*)}] 
\item If we are given a potential $V(x)$, then the stable equilibrium positions of $V(x)$ will be found at the zeros of $V'(x)$. We find that the derivative of the potential is given by 
\[V'(x) = 0 = 4x^3 + 12ax^2 - 16a^2 x.\]
Factoring out $4x$ from both sides of the equation gives us 
\[x^2 + 3ax - 4a^2 = 0.\]
Factoring this equation gives us 
\[-(a-x)(4a + x) = 0\implies x = a, 4a.\]

\item As seen in the lecture, we have that 
\[F(x) \approx -V^{''}(x) x\implies \omega = \sqrt{\frac{V^{''}(x)}{m}}.\]
By taking the second derivative, we have that 
\[V^{\prime \prime} (x) = 2x + 3a.\]
We can evaluate $V^{\prime \prime} (x)$ at both of our equilibrium points $x = a, 4a$. At $x=a$, 
\[V^{\prime \prime} (a) = 5a\implies \omega = \sqrt{\frac{5a}{m}}\]
and at $x = -4a$, 
\[V^{\prime \prime} (4a) = 11a\implies \omega = \sqrt{\frac{11a}{m}}.\]
